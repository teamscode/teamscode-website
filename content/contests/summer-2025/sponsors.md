### About X-Camp Academy

X-Camp Academy was founded in August 2017 in Silicon Valley by two Google software
engineers. Their mission is to inspire and cultivate the next generation of computer science and artificial intelligence talents, which  they believe will have a positive impact on the future. The younger generations will have unlimited opportunities at X-Camp for many reasons.

They have a unique curriculum, inherited from Mr. Xianyou Xu, a Chinese diamond-level international gold medal coach. Mr. Xu has been training students to participate in programming competitions, especially Olympics in Informatics, for more than 20 years.

X-Camp prioritizes personalized education, with problem sets tailored to each student’s needs and an enrollment system that encourages grade skipping. By participating in team-based competitions and facilitating frequent group study sessions, X-Camp also fosters an environment of collaboration to build each student’s confidence in their ability to code.

X-Camp’s staff are composed of senior software engineers from major technology companies in Silicon Valley. They have strong support from international and domestic competition winners.

### About Art of Problem Solving

Since 1993, AoPS has helped hundreds of thousands of passionate students succeed in the classroom and beyond. We know that learning math means more than memorizing formulas or doing lots of simple calculations quickly. Students deserve teachers and peers who share their enthusiasm and a curriculum that helps them think critically and understand concepts on a deeper level. AoPS provides the opportunity to learn to solve problems by trying, failing, and ultimately succeeding.
