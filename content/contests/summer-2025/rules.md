## General Rules

* Only teams with only middle or high school students (rising 6th - senior) are eligible for prizes, however everyone (college students, workers) is welcome to compete.
* Each team may have up to 4 people. Team members may not receive any help from anyone outside of their team.
* Teams must submit at least once to be eligible for raffle prizes.
* Teams may use multiple computers and submit answers in multiple languages.
* Pre-written code and online reference guides are allowed (in other words, internet is allowed so long as you’re not asking people how to solve our problem).
* We reserve the right to disqualify participants who intentionally participate in divisions with problem difficulties that are too low for the skill level of the participant. For example, USACO finalists and International Masters on Codeforces cannot participate in the Novice division. We do not tolerate those who attempt to undermine the fairness of the competition.
* There are two divisions: **Novice** and **Advanced**. We expect each division will be interesting for participants of the following skill levels:
  * The novice division is intended for students who know programming but have not started or have just started competitive programming:
    * Taking or have taken APCS
    * USACO Bronze-Silver
    * 0 - 1500 Codeforces rating
  * The advanced division is intended for anyone who is confident in their competitive programming ability:
    * USACO Gold and above
    * 1600+ Codeforces rating

## Problem Format

* Description: an overview of the problem.
* Input Format: specifies how the input will be formatted, including constraints on the size of parameters. (constraints may be stated in the Description).
* Output Format: specifies how the output should be formatted - if you don’t follow this format exactly, your answer will most likely be marked as incorrect.
* Sample Input: provides a sample input to help you test your code.
* Sample Output: provides the expected output to the sample input.
* Sample Explanation: provides an explanation of how the sample output was obtained from the sample input.

## Submitting Solutions

* Allowed Languages: C++, C, Java, Python 2, Python 3
* Solutions will be submitted through the contest page listed above. The code for each problem should be copy-pasted into the box that appears after clicking “Submit Code”.
* For Java submissions, the class name of your main function must be ```Main```.
* The file size containing your code must not exceed 50 KB.
* Default Constraints
  * Note that constraints may vary depending on the problem.
  * Time Limit: Your program must run in under 2,000 ms (2 seconds) for C and C++, under 4,000 ms (4 seconds) for Java, and under 8,000 ms (8 seconds) for Python.  Time limits for each language may be different if specified in a problem.
  * Memory Limit: The program's memory must not exceed 256 MB
* Use **Standard Input** in your code. This means that test cases are directly typed into the console. Here’s an example for each of the allowed languages:<br>**Java:** `Scanner(System.in)`  **C++:** `cin>>` **Python:** `input()`    **C:** `scanf()`
* Use **Standard Output** in your code. This means that the output directly prints to the console. Here’s what standard output looks like for each of the languages:<br>**Java:** `System.out.println()`  **C++:** `cout<<` **Python:** `print()` **C:** `printf()`

## Scoring

### Problem Difficulty

* There are ~10 total problems in ascending order of difficulty.

### Problem Points

* All problems are each worth 100 points. Each problem has some number of tests (usually 10 or 20). Sample test is worth 0 point. If you solve X non-sample tests correctly for a problem with Y non-sample tests, you get (X/Y * 100) points.
* Note that each test may have multiple test cases where each test case must be solved correctly to get points for the test.
* Output must match **exactly** with expected output to receive points for the test case - there is no partial credit.

### Problem Tests

* The first test is always the sample given in the problem.
* Some problems will have explicitly stated subtasks. For example, a problem with 10 tests may have tests 1-5 with N<=10 and tests 6-10 with N<=100.

### Ties

* Ties will be broken by the timestamp on the last submission that increases your total score.
